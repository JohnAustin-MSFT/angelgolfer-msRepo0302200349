# Use the Microsoft Graph API for security threat detection and protection

{Use this topic to describe briefly each of the 2 API sets - ID risk detection, and security API. One paragraph each.}

Today's security breaches often times start with attackers gaining access to a user's identity in an environment. Having access to even a low-privileged user account makes it possible for attackers to gain access to important organization resources. The [identity protection API](identityprotection_root.md) in Microsoft Graph lets you [integrate with Azure Active Directory Identity Protection](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/active-directory-identityprotection-graph-getting-started), and detect potential vulnerabilities affecting identities in your organization.

{Similar high level background intro to the security API. Avoid repeating what is in security-api-overview.md at lengths.}
